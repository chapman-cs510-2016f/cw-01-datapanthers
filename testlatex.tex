\begin{problem}{1}
 What does derivative f'(x) of a function f(x) mean exactly?
\end{problem}
 
\begin{solution} %Explaining what F(x)' means

A derivative shows the change in the curve at any point of the curve; 
an instantaneous rate of change of a function. 

By definition, the derivative of f(x) with respect to x is the function f'(x) and is defined: 

\[ f'(x) \lim_{h \to 0} = \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \]



For example, take the equation: 
\[ f(x) = x^2\]

\end{figure}

What we have found is that the derivative \[ f(x) = x^2\] at a point x, is the slope of the line tangent to the curve of \[ y = x^2\]. So for example, if x = 1, then the slope of our tangent line will be 2.
